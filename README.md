# Capstone Project
**Created by Holli Meyers**, at the University of Washington. <br/><br/>

## Background
The project was inspired from 

The effects of climate change are to only increase. Coupled with the impacts of other human caused issues, our environment is to continue facing extreme and variable patterns that will be life altering. Thus, it’s important the public has easily accessible access to the real-time data that’s gathered globally to stay informed and allow them to plan accordingly to their current or sought out location.
Real-time environmental data is collected from a variety of different sources and locations, only some of which can actually be easily found and understood by the general public. Yet, none provide a consolidated overview of the information. This is especially true for oceanic data, which never seems to be included in weather applications. Navigating between fragmented data sources can be difficult for the average user. It requires time and patience finding sites that not only hold the correct information they seek in relation to the desired location, but also an intuitive format that makes sense and doesn’t require special downloads or software.

The project aims to design and implement a centralized web application that integrates real-time atmospheric and other weather-related information with oceanic data. To accommodate the fragmented data across government agencies, universities, research institutions, and other organizations, the platform will use schema mapping to draw data from its various structured information sources. Consequently, presenting the information systems into a unified, accessible format with features that allow users to quickly and easily, access an enhanced weather overview for their desired area.

### Current Applications


## Overview
The repository contains a new portable information structure. <br/>

**Data Sources:** <br/>
Ocean buoy data map, list, guide, and description - https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/ / https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/data/latest_obs/latest_obs.txt / https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/docs/ndbc_web_data_guide.pdf / https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/faq/measdes.shtml <br/>

**TBD Data Integration Sources:** <br/>
Real-time data file list - https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/data/realtime2/ <br/>
Global monitoring data map - https://viz.pmel.noaa.gov/osmc/?color_by=platform_type&platform_code=PTAW1 <br/>
US tide and current data - https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/map/

## Methods
1. Download a code editor like Visual Studio (VS) Code to set up a development environment.
2. Download the files in the repository to a designated project folder on your computer.
3. Open the folder in VS Code.
4. Run the code to view the web application.
